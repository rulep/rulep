### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h1 align='center'> Hello, there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulep/rulep/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> </h1>

I come from a non-technical background having studied Computerized Accounting. I took up Wed Development as a hobby. During my studies, I came across the Thinkful platform, where I learned more about the program. As my interests aligned with it's offerings, I signed on to take this hobby to the next level by making a social impact through programming. I'm always looking for new friends to build cool things. If you're interested in working on a project together, don't hesitate to contact me.
