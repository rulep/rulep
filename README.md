My name is Rouan, and I come from a non-technical background having studied Computerized Accounting. I took up Wed Development as a hobby. During my studies, I came across the <em><a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a></em> platform, where I learned more about the program. As my interests aligned with it's offerings, I signed on to take this hobby to the next level by making a social impact through programming. I'm always looking for new friends to build cool things. If you're interested in working on a project together, don't hesitate to contact me ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
